# Stack policy

Applies To: All Wrelik apps

## Purpose
Define the authoritative Wrelik modular stack and adapter boundaries so application code stays vendor-agnostic.

## Scope
This policy governs backend/frontend runtime integrations, data access patterns, observability, and platform adapters.

## Requirements
- Application code MUST consume external capabilities through `@wrelik/*` adapters whenever an adapter exists.
- Application code MUST NOT directly import vendor SDKs that are already abstracted by Wrelik packages.
- New vendors MUST be approved with a written architecture decision.
- Multi-tenant data access MUST enforce tenant scoping in every request path.

Authoritative mapping:

| Function | Vendor | Adapter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon) | `@wrelik/db` |
| Auth | Clerk | `@wrelik/auth` |
| Storage | Cloudflare R2 | `@wrelik/storage` |
| Analytics | PostHog | `@wrelik/analytics` |
| Errors | Sentry | `@wrelik/errors` |
| Email | Resend | `@wrelik/email` |
| Jobs | Inngest | `@wrelik/jobs` |
| Config | Environment schemas | `@wrelik/config` |

## Procedure
1. Select the required capability from the mapping table.
2. Integrate only via the corresponding `@wrelik/*` package.
3. Initialize adapters centrally in app bootstrap code.
4. Add tests that confirm tenant isolation and adapter integration behavior.

## Exceptions
If an adapter does not exist for a required capability:
- Teams MAY use a direct vendor SDK temporarily.
- A decision record and migration plan to a shared adapter MUST be created.
- The exception MUST be time-bound and tracked.
