# Versioning policy

Applies To: All Wrelik apps

## Purpose
Standardize semantic versioning and release artifact expectations across Wrelik repositories.

## Scope
This policy applies to package versions, changelog entries, and release communication artifacts.

## Requirements
- Repositories MUST follow Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- Wrelik monorepos SHOULD use Changesets as the primary source for package version changes.
- Every shipped behavioral change MUST have a corresponding changelog/release note entry.
- Version bumps MUST match the impact level:
- `MAJOR`: breaking changes.
- `MINOR`: backward-compatible features.
- `PATCH`: backward-compatible fixes.

Changesets-first standard:
1. Add a changeset file for each publishable package change.
2. Select semantic bump type per package.
3. Include concise, factual summary.
4. Merge via PR; publish via repository release workflow.

Single-app adaptation (optional):
- If a repository is not package-based, teams MAY maintain a root `CHANGELOG.md` and optional `VERSION` file.
- This adaptation MUST still preserve SemVer rules and release-note discipline.

## Procedure
1. Classify change impact.
2. Create versioning artifact:
- Changeset (preferred).
- Root changelog entry (single-app adaptation).
3. Validate consistency between code changes and release notes.
4. Include versioning artifacts in the same pull request.

## Exceptions
Security hotfixes MAY be expedited, but MUST still receive retroactive release note updates within one business day.
